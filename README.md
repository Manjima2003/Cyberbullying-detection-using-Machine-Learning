# Cyberbullying Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect instances of cyberbullying in text data using machine learning algorithms. The application is designed to analyze text from social media and other online communication channels to identify abusive language, harassment patterns, and indicators of cyberbullying in real-time.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Detection of cyberbullying based on trained machine learning models
- Comparative evaluation of four algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes
- Visualized performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC)
- Implementation of TF-IDF vectorization for text representation
